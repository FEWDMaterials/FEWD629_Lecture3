{"home":{"content":"# Lecture 3: Practical CSS and the Box Model\n---\n\nWelcome to Lecture 3! Here's a brief class breakdown.\n\n#### Learning Objectives\n---\n\n1. Understand how to write [modular, reusable](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/) CSS code\n2. Learn about the Box Model, a CSS layout paradigm\n\n#### Rundown\n---\n\n#### [Warmup](#warmup)\n#### [Practical CSS3 Usecases](#practice-css3-usecases)\n#### [The Box Model](#the-box-model)\n#### [Build a Landing Page](#build-a-landing-page)","idx":0},"title":{"content":"CSS and the Box Model\n","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"CSS Practice and intro to the box model","idx":2},"warmup":{"content":"# Warmup\n---\n\nLet's begin by working on our problem from Monday.\n\n#### Wendy Bite\n---\n\nThe starter code that we wrote from last week is **[located here](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/FEWD629_Lecture2_WendyBite_starter)**.\n\nThere is some ugly CSS here as well, we will probably remove that.\n\n<p></p>\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FEWDMaterials/WendyBite_BEM/master/assignmentMaterials/WendyBite_AboutMe.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p></p>","idx":3},"practical-css3-usecases":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Usecases\n---\n\nThese are examples of CSS3 uses that we will either cover **today** or **at some point** in the duration of the course.\n\n#### Exercise\n---\nSee if you can implement some of the more simple ones outlined here into one of your websites (either the resume or the Wendy Bite).\n\n#### CSS Use Cases\n---\n\nHere are some interesting use cases where CSS3 in particular becomes super handy.\n\n#### Animations\n---\n\nYou can do some really awesome work with animating your elements.\n\n* **[Spinner](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/42730)**\n\n* **[Repeating, multiple animations](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4270)**\n\n#### Transitions\n---\n\nTransitions are animations that are triggered usually by some form of user interaction.\n\n* **[Hover Effects](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4268)**\n\n#### Pseudo Selectors\n---\n\nPsuedo classes allow us to style specific types of element features, **i.e.** the **:hover** pseudo selector can be used to style an element as the user puts his mouse over it.\n\n* **[Menu Hover Effect](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4957)**\n\nOther examples of pseudo selectors: **:visited**, **:after**, etc\n\n#### Overflows\n---\n\nKeep track of content and determine how it should behave if there is more content than space in the container.\n\n* **[Overflow Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4165)**\n\n#### Grids\n---\n\nThis one is super expansive and you could literally teach an entire course on this. For now, take a look at a few examples / problems to gain perspective on this.\n\n* **[Vertically and Horizontally Center](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10099)**\n\n* **[Three Column Grid](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4258)**\n\n* **[Flex Align/Justify](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10100)**\n\n* **[Flex Direction](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10097)**\n\n* **[Flex Wrap](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10098)**\n\n#### References\n---\n1. **[Exhaustive Guide to Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)**\n2. **[CSS Animations Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)**\n3. \n**[Exhaustive list of CSS properties and values](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)**\n4. **[Exhaustive list of CSS3 properties](http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css3-properties.php)**\n","idx":4},"the-box-model":{"content":"# The Box Model\n---\n\nThe Box Model is a way of thinking about CSS DOM elements on the page. Instead of thinking of HTML elements as bits of HTML wrappers we style, we can think of them as boxes with specific dimensions and properties. Given this though, an HTML layout can be thought of as boxes within boxes.\n\n#### Exercises\n---\n\n1. ##### [Display Inline to Block](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Inline_to_block) | [LIVE Instructor Version](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Inline_to_block)\n\n2. ##### [Display Block to Inline-Block](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Inline_block_only) | [LIVE Instructor Version](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Inline_block_only)\n\n3. ##### [Simple Layouts](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Simple_Layout) | [LIVE Instructor Version](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Box_Model_Simple_Layout)\n\n#### Margin, Padding, Border\n---\n\n**Margin**: space in **between** DOM elements\n\n**Padding**: space **within** the DOM element\n\n**Border**: the outline **around** the DOM Element.\n\nIn general, the width of a DOM element is **padding** + **border** + **content**.\n\n#### Implications\n---\nThe main implications of this has to do with building **rows** with multiple tags / items inside of it. \n\nThe widths adding up to 100% isn't enough -- the **width** + **padding** + **border** + **margin** must add up to 100%!\n\n#### Box Sizing\n---\n\nThis is a useful tool. We can use box-sizing to force the padding to be **pulled into** our content width. This way, padding is **not** added to the overall width.\n\n**Types**: content-box, border-box\n\n","idx":5},"build-a-landing-page":{"content":"# Build a Landing Page\n---\n\nOk, activity time. **Let's build a sample landing page using a front-end framework and our current knowledge of CSS.**\n\n#### Options\n---\n\nLet's just choose one of these and get going.\n\nWe must **also** choose **one** of the four frontend frameworks we saw to help us build ou the grids and other UI elements. Or, we can just build from scratch. \n\n**Also note that** we **will** be pushing this to the internet via GitHub + [GitBot](http://gitbot.co).\n\n#### [BaseCamp](https://basecamp.com/)\n\n<p></p>\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/hubfs/basecamp-landing-page-example.png?noresize&t=1468231454139&width=660&height=427\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n\n\n#### [Wistia](https://wistia.com/account/signup)\n\n<p></p>\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/hubfs/wisita-landing-page-example.png?noresize&t=1468231454139&width=660\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n","idx":6},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","practical-css3-usecases","the-box-model","build-a-landing-page"]}
